# Jaccard

I've provided a Python code snippet that involves data manipulation and calculations using the pandas library. This code is aimed at calculating the Jaccard similarity between pairs of customers based on their purchased products and finding the pair of customers with the highest Jaccard similarity.

The code reads a CSV file containing customer-product data, calculates the Jaccard similarity between each pair of customers, and then identifies the pair with the highest Jaccard similarity.
